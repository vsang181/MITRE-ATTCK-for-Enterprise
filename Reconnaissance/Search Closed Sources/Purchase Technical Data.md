# Purchase Technical Data

Purchase Technical Data is a sub-technique of Search Closed Sources (**MITRE ATT&CK T1597.002**) in which adversaries acquire technical intelligence about target organisations directly through purchase — either from legitimate but restricted commercial data aggregation services, or from illicit dark web and cybercrime marketplaces.  Unlike **T1597.001 – Threat Intel Vendors**, which focuses on extracting intelligence from security-oriented subscription platforms, T1597.002 encompasses the full spectrum of purchasable technical data, including stolen credentials, active session tokens, initial network access, employee contact information, and infrastructure-specific vulnerability data obtained from criminal underground economies. 
The technique is operationally significant because purchased technical data can dramatically compress the adversary's timeline to initial access. Where conventional reconnaissance requires extended OSINT collection and active scanning to identify exploitable opportunities, purchased data may deliver valid credentials, authenticated session cookies, or pre-established network access for specific targets immediately upon payment.  Intelligence gathered through this technique can directly inform further reconnaissance (e.g., **T1598 – Phishing for Information**, **T1593 – Search Open Websites/Domains**), support resource development (e.g., **T1587 – Develop Capabilities**, **T1588 – Obtain Capabilities**), and enable initial access via **T1133 – External Remote Services** and **T1078 – Valid Accounts**.

## The Underground Technical Data Market

The dark web and cybercrime ecosystem supports a mature and segmented marketplace for technical data, with distinct market categories serving different adversarial needs: 

- **Credential markets:** Dark web forums and automated credential shops sell username and password pairs harvested from prior data breaches, infostealer malware campaigns, and credential-stuffing operations at scale. Credentials are frequently sold as searchable databases queryable by target domain, enabling adversaries to retrieve all known compromised credentials for a specific organisation's email domain rapidly and cheaply. Platforms including **RaidForums** (now defunct), **BreachForums**, and automated shops such as **Genesis Market** (seized by law enforcement in 2023) have historically provided this capability.
- **Session token markets:** Authenticated session cookies and OAuth tokens captured through infostealer malware — including **RedLine Stealer**, **Raccoon Stealer**, and **Vidar** — are sold in near real-time through automated shops, providing adversaries with authenticated access to cloud services, SaaS platforms, VPNs, and corporate applications without requiring knowledge of the account password or the ability to defeat MFA.
- **Initial Access Broker (IAB) listings:** Threat actors who have already compromised an organisation sell authenticated access — including active VPN sessions, RDP endpoints, corporate intranets, and web shells — through dark web forums. IAB listings typically specify the target organisation's name or sector, the type of access available, the estimated revenue of the organisation, and the asking price, enabling purchasing adversaries to acquire precise, operationally validated access into a specific target without conducting any reconnaissance or exploitation themselves.
- **Employee contact and PII datasets:** Corporate employee datasets derived from breached HR databases, LinkedIn scrapes, and corporate directory leaks provide adversaries with accurate, structured employee contact information — names, job titles, corporate email addresses, and direct phone numbers — at scale, enabling rapid construction of targeted spearphishing and vishing campaign lists.
- **Vulnerability and exploit marketplaces:** Private vulnerability research and working exploit code for specific software targets are sold through specialised dark web marketplaces, enabling adversaries who lack internal research capability to acquire operational exploits for identified target technologies. Both contracted models (paying researchers to find vulnerabilities in specific targets) and purchase models (buying vulnerabilities already discovered by researchers) are documented operational patterns within underground exploit markets.

## Procedure Examples

### LAPSUS$
**LAPSUS$** operationally integrated the purchase of technical data as a core component of its initial access methodology, purchasing **credentials and session tokens** from criminal underground forums as one of several parallel methods for obtaining authenticated access to victim environments.  Microsoft's analysis of LAPSUS$ TTPs documented that the group used a deliberately diverse access acquisition strategy: alongside purchasing credentials from underground markets, the group deployed **RedLine Stealer** to harvest passwords and session tokens from compromised systems, paid employees and contractors at targeted organisations directly for their credentials and MFA approvals, and searched public code repositories for inadvertently exposed credentials.  Once in possession of valid credentials or session tokens — regardless of acquisition method — the group used them to authenticate to internet-facing services including **VPN**, **RDP**, **Citrix Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)**, **Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Entra ID)**, and **Okta**, bypassing perimeter controls entirely by presenting legitimate authentication material.

LAPSUS$ additionally established a structured Telegram channel that functioned as a communication, recruitment, and extortion platform, demonstrating the group's sophisticated integration of dark web and messaging platform infrastructure into its operational model.  After achieving initial access through purchased or otherwise acquired credentials, the group used **AD Explorer** to enumerate domain users and groups, subsequently deploying **DCSync attacks** and **Mimikatz** for privilege escalation to domain administrator.  The group's high-profile victims — including **Microsoft**, **NVIDIA**, **Samsung**, **Okta**, and **Ubisoft** — were compromised through this credential-centric methodology, demonstrating that technically sophisticated exploitation is not required when purchased valid credentials provide a direct authenticated path into enterprise environments.

## Mitigations: Pre-Compromise (MITRE M1056)

Purchase Technical Data reconnaissance operates entirely within external dark web and commercial marketplaces, placing collection activity entirely outside the reach of enterprise defensive controls.  Mitigation efforts should focus on limiting the technical data available for purchase, rapidly neutralising the access value of data already in circulation, and hardening authentication to prevent purchased credentials and session tokens from enabling account takeover: 

- **Continuous credential exposure monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring of dark web breach databases for the organisation's credentials using services such as [SpyCloud Enterprise](https://spycloud.com/), [Recorded Future Identity Intelligence](https://www.recordedfuture.com/), [Flare](https://flare.io/), and [DarkOwl Vision](https://www.darkowl.com/), enabling rapid forced password resets and session invalidation for exposed accounts before adversaries can operationally exploit purchased credentials. 
- **Deploy phishing-resistant MFA universally:** Enforcing **FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware security key** authentication (e.g., [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/), [Google Titan Security Key](https://store.google.com/gb/category/security-keys)) across all internet-facing authentication surfaces — VPN, SSO, cloud management portals, email — prevents purchased static credentials from enabling account takeover, as FIDO2 authentication requires physical possession of the hardware key and cannot be replayed from purchased credential sets.
- **Session token theft countermeasures:** Implement **token binding** and **Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)** in **Microsoft Entra ID** to invalidate session tokens in real time when anomalous access conditions are detected, reducing the operational window during which purchased session tokens captured through infostealer malware remain exploitable.  Enforce **conditional access policies** requiring device compliance and Entra ID join status, ensuring that session tokens used from non-compliant or unrecognised devices trigger re-authentication challenges.
- **Infostealer malware prevention:** Deploy comprehensive endpoint protection including [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint) and [CrowdStrike Falcon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) with infostealer detection coverage to prevent RedLine Stealer, Raccoon Stealer, and similar credential-harvesting malware from capturing credentials and session tokens from employee devices, reducing the supply of organisational credentials entering underground markets.
- **Employee security awareness on insider threats:** Train employees to recognise and report recruitment attempts by threat actors seeking to purchase credentials or MFA approvals directly from insiders — a documented LAPSUS$ tactic — emphasising the legal and professional consequences of selling organisational access.
- **Credential hygiene and secrets management:** Implement mandatory **secrets scanning** across all code repositories using tools such as [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/features/security) and [truffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) to prevent inadvertent exposure of API keys, access tokens, and credentials in public or internal repositories, eliminating one of the documented LAPSUS$ credential collection vectors.

## Detection Strategy

### Complete Passive Collection Opacity
Purchase Technical Data activity is conducted entirely within external dark web and commercial data marketplaces, generating no observable artefacts within the target organisation's IT infrastructure.  Direct detection of this activity is entirely infeasible through conventional monitoring controls.

### Detection Pivot to Credential Exploitation and Anomalous Authentication

Detection resources should focus on the downstream authentication and access events through which purchased credentials and session tokens are operationally exploited:

- **Anomalous authentication monitoring:** Monitor **Entra ID**, **Okta**, and VPN authentication logs for successful logins using valid credentials from unexpected geographic locations, previously unseen devices, anonymising infrastructure (VPN, Tor exit nodes, hosting provider IP ranges), or at unusual times inconsistent with the authenticated account holder's established access patterns. Apply **Entra ID Identity Protection** risk-based conditional access to block or step up high-risk sign-in attempts.
- **Session token replay detection:** Monitor for authentication events using session tokens from IP addresses and user agents inconsistent with the session's origin, particularly tokens used from multiple geographic locations in rapid succession, characteristic of purchased session token replay. Implement **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps** anomaly detection policies for impossible travel and token session anomalies.
- **Credential stuffing detection:** Monitor authentication endpoints for credential stuffing patterns — high-volume authentication attempts across multiple accounts from single or rotating IP addresses within short time windows — characteristic of adversaries validating bulk purchased credential sets, using **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** rate limiting on [Azure Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/application-gateway) and [Cloudflare WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/waf/).
- **Dark web alert integration into IR workflows:** Integrate dark web monitoring alerts from services such as [SpyCloud](https://spycloud.com/) and [Flare](https://flare.io/) directly into **SIEM** correlation workflows in [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) or [Microsoft Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-sentinel), treating confirmed credential exposure as a **Potential Compromise Indicator** requiring immediate investigation of authentication logs for evidence of purchased credential exploitation, rather than treating breach alerts as informational notifications requiring no immediate action.
- **Initial Access Broker intelligence monitoring:** Subscribe to threat intelligence services that specifically monitor IAB forum activity including [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/), [Flare](https://flare.io/), and [Cybersixgill](https://cybersixgill.com/) to receive early warning when authenticated access to the organisation's network is being actively marketed on dark web forums, enabling incident response engagement before the purchasing adversary begins conducting follow-on operations.
