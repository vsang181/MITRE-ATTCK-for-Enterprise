# Search Open Technical Databases

Search Open Technical Databases is a reconnaissance technique classified under **MITRE ATT&CK T1596** in which adversaries query freely accessible technical databases and repositories to gather intelligence about target organisations' internet-facing infrastructure, domain registrations, certificate configurations, and network exposure.  Unlike closed source reconnaissance (T1597), the data sources exploited here are entirely free and publicly accessible — requiring no subscription, dark web access, or illicit purchase — making this one of the lowest-barrier and highest-return reconnaissance techniques available to adversaries at any capability level. 

Intelligence gathered through open technical databases can directly inform further reconnaissance (e.g., **T1598 – Phishing for Information**, **T1593 – Search Open Websites/Domains**), support resource development (e.g., **T1583 – Acquire Infrastructure**, **T1584 – Compromise Infrastructure**), and enable initial access via **T1133 – External Remote Services** and **T1199 – Trusted Relationship**.

## The Dual-Use Problem: Defender Tools as Adversary Resources

The open technical databases exploited under T1596 are, in the vast majority of cases, the same platforms used by legitimate security professionals for attack surface management, threat hunting, and incident investigation.  Platforms including [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), [Censys](https://censys.io/), [SecurityTrails](https://securitytrails.com/), [DNSDumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/), and [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) are freely accessible to any user with an account, with premium tiers offering substantially richer query capabilities.  This creates a fundamental asymmetry: defensive investments in internet-facing infrastructure simultaneously improve an organisation's security posture and increase the accuracy and richness of the intelligence available to adversaries querying these same platforms.

## Procedure Examples

### APT28 and Kimsuky: AI-Augmented Open Database Reconnaissance
Both **APT28** and **Kimsuky** have operationally integrated **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into their open technical database reconnaissance workflows, representing a significant evolution in the speed and sophistication with which threat actors can process and operationalise intelligence gathered from open databases.  **APT28** used LLMs to assist in script development and deployment — enabling automation of data collection and analysis from open technical databases at scale.  **Kimsuky** specifically used LLMs to better understand publicly reported vulnerabilities, using AI-assisted analysis to interpret and operationalise CVE disclosures and vulnerability research in ways that would previously have required specialist human research capability.  This use of AI to augment open technical database reconnaissance compresses the time between vulnerability disclosure and exploitation targeting, as adversaries can rapidly query scan databases for affected systems and concurrently use LLMs to analyse the vulnerability and develop operational exploitation approaches.

## Mitigations: Pre-Compromise (MITRE M1056)

Open technical database reconnaissance is conducted entirely through legitimate publicly accessible platforms, generating no artefacts within the target organisation's infrastructure.  Mitigation efforts must focus on reducing the intelligence quality available through these platforms and proactively identifying what adversaries can currently see: 

- **Suppress service banner and version disclosure:** Remove software vendor and version strings from HTTP response headers (`Server:`, `X-Powered-By:`), management interface login pages, and all internet-facing service banners. This directly degrades the quality of intelligence available through scan database queries against the organisation's IP ranges. 
- **WHOIS privacy protection:** Enable **WHOIS privacy protection** (GDPR-aligned registrar privacy services) for all registered domains to prevent registrant contact information from being harvested for social engineering and spearphishing targeting. 
- **DNSSEC deployment:** Enable **DNSSEC** on all organisational domains to prevent DNS record tampering and to authenticate DNS responses, reducing the exploitability of DNS infrastructure intelligence gathered through passive DNS queries. 
- **Certificate Transparency monitoring:** Actively monitor CT logs for newly issued certificates referencing the organisation's domains and brand names using services such as [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) and [Certstream](https://certstream.calidog.io/), enabling rapid identification of domain impersonation certificates issued for typosquatting and phishing infrastructure. 
- **External attack surface management (EASM):** Continuously assess the organisation's own internet-facing exposure using [Microsoft Defender EASM](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-external-attack-surface-management) and [Censys ASM](https://censys.io/) to understand precisely what intelligence is currently available to adversaries querying scan databases, enabling proactive hardening — particularly of forgotten or undocumented assets — before adversaries act on it.
- **Minimise internet-facing attack surface:** Identify and decommission or network-isolate internet-facing management interfaces (RDP, SSH, VNC, SNMP, Telnet) that are indexed in scan databases, placing them behind VPN or Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) gateways to remove them from public scan database indexing.

## Detection Strategy

### Complete Passive Collection Opacity
All five sub-techniques of T1596 are executed through queries to external publicly accessible platforms, generating no observable network or endpoint artefacts within the target organisation.  Direct detection of this reconnaissance activity is entirely infeasible. 

### Proactive Self-Assessment and Downstream Exploitation Detection

- **Conduct regular external infrastructure scans as the organisation:** Periodically query [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), [Censys](https://censys.io/), and [SecurityTrails](https://securitytrails.com/) from the perspective of an adversary, using the organisation's own domain names, ASN, and IP ranges as query inputs, to understand what intelligence is currently available and to identify scan database entries for services requiring urgent remediation.
- **Exploitation attempt detection for identified vulnerabilities:** Configure **IDS/IPS** platforms with detection rules targeting exploitation of vulnerabilities affecting software versions indexed in scan databases for the organisation's IP ranges, recognising that adversaries who query scan databases to identify vulnerable services will operationalise that intelligence against those specific systems.
- **Subdomain enumeration and new asset monitoring:** Monitor for unexpected inbound connections to subdomains and IP addresses identified through passive DNS and certificate transparency reconnaissance, using **SIEM** correlation in [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) or [Microsoft Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-sentinel) to alert on access attempts to services that should not be receiving external traffic.
