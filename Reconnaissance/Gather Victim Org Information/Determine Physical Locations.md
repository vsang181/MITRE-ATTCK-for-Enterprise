# Determine Physical Locations

Determine Physical Locations is a sub-technique of Gather Victim Org Information (**MITRE ATT&CK T1591.001**) in which adversaries collect intelligence about the physical locations of a target organisation's facilities, operations, and key infrastructure.  Collectible location intelligence encompasses a broad range of operationally useful details including corporate headquarters addresses, satellite office locations, data centre and colocation facility sites, manufacturing or operational plant locations, and the geographic positioning of key technical infrastructure components.  Physical location intelligence additionally reveals the **legal jurisdiction(s)** within which the target operates, which has significant operational implications for adversaries: it informs the scope of law enforcement and regulatory authority applicable to the target, identifies data sovereignty regimes governing the target's data handling obligations, and indicates whether specific legal or investigative constraints may limit the speed or scope of incident response and law enforcement engagement. 

The intelligence gathered during this sub-technique can directly inform further reconnaissance (e.g., **T1598 – Phishing for Information**, **T1593 – Search Open Websites/Domains**), support resource development (e.g., **T1587 – Develop Capabilities**, **T1588 – Obtain Capabilities**), and enable both cyber and physical initial access vectors including **T1566 – Phishing** and **T1200 – Hardware Additions**, the latter of which requires physical proximity to target facilities.

## Collection Vectors

Adversaries use a combination of passive OSINT and active elicitation methods to enumerate the physical locations of target organisations:

- **Corporate Websites and Staff Directories:** Organisations routinely publish office addresses, contact details, and facility location maps on their public-facing websites, providing a directly accessible starting point for physical location enumeration. Regional office pages, "Contact Us" pages, and interactive store or facility finders expose specific address-level location data for all publicly disclosed facilities.
- **Social Media and Professional Networks:** Employee posts on platforms including **LinkedIn**, **Twitter/X**, and **Instagram** routinely disclose office locations through geotag data, "at the office" check-ins, event attendance posts, and references to specific buildings and campuses. LinkedIn company pages frequently list office locations for all regional and international offices, exposing the complete disclosed geographic footprint of an organisation.
- **Press Releases and Annual Reports:** Corporate communications including press releases, annual reports, investor presentations, and real estate announcements disclose new facility openings, lease signings, and office relocations, providing adversaries with a continuously updated record of the organisation's physical footprint. Regulatory filings such as **UK Companies House** submissions and **SEC 10-K** annual reports require the disclosure of principal business addresses and in many cases operational facility inventories.
- **Google Maps and Satellite Imagery:** Platforms including [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/), [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/), and commercial satellite imagery services enable adversaries to conduct detailed visual reconnaissance of disclosed facility addresses, identifying physical security arrangements, entry and exit points, adjacent infrastructure, and surrounding geography without requiring physical presence near the target location.
- **Geolocation of Phishing Site Visitors:** Adversaries instrument phishing and credential harvesting pages to capture the IP addresses of visiting users and resolve them to approximate geographic locations using IP geolocation services. As documented in **Magic Hound's** operational use of this technique, visitor location data collected from phishing infrastructure enables adversaries to map the geographic distribution of target organisation employees and identify the physical locations from which personnel access internet resources. 
- **Job Postings:** Employment advertisements frequently specify the physical office or facility location of the advertised role, providing adversaries with location intelligence for specific organisational functions and departments. Job postings referencing on-site requirements, specific office addresses, or regional office locations can rapidly enumerate the geographic distribution of key organisational functions including IT operations, finance, and executive leadership.
- **Physical Reconnaissance:** Adversaries with sufficient motivation and resources may conduct physical surveillance of identified facility locations to gather additional intelligence about building security arrangements, delivery schedules, access control mechanisms, and employee movement patterns, in support of physical access vectors such as **T1200 – Hardware Additions** or tailgating-based physical intrusion.

## Procedure Examples

### Magic Hound (APT35 / Charming Kitten)
**Magic Hound** instrumentally integrated physical location intelligence collection into its phishing infrastructure operations, configuring credential harvesting pages to **collect and log the geographic location of all site visitors** derived from IP geolocation resolution of visitor IP addresses.  This technique enabled the group to build a geographic profile of the target organisation's personnel, confirming which physical locations housed employees engaging with the phishing infrastructure and potentially identifying the geographic distribution of high-value personnel categories such as executives, IT administrators, and financial approvers across the target's office locations. The geolocation data could then be operationally applied to scope targeted delivery of follow-on phishing campaigns, inform impersonation lures referencing specific office locations, and support physical access planning where warranted.

## Mitigations: Pre-Compromise (MITRE M1056)

Physical location intelligence is gathered predominantly through passive OSINT collection against publicly accessible data sources, placing collection activity outside the reach of conventional enterprise network controls.  Mitigation efforts should focus on limiting the location intelligence available to adversaries and hardening physical access against the scenarios that this intelligence enables: 

- **Restrict granular location disclosure:** Audit public-facing websites, social media profiles, and press releases to minimise the specificity of facility location details published to external parties. Consider whether data centre and colocation facility locations should be publicly disclosed at all, given the operational security implications of exposing critical infrastructure locations to potential adversaries.
- **Employee social media and geolocation awareness:** Educate employees on the risks of disclosing specific office locations, facility names, and building details through social media posts, location check-ins, and geotagged photographs. Specific guidance should address the disabling of automatic geolocation metadata embedding in photographs shared publicly and the avoidance of posts that confirm physical presence at sensitive facilities.
- **Phishing site visitor geolocation countermeasures:** Implement **corporate VPN enforcement policies** requiring all employees to route internet-bound traffic through corporate VPN infrastructure, ensuring that the IP addresses exposed to adversary-controlled phishing infrastructure reflect corporate egress points rather than individual employee residential or office locations. This limits the geographic precision of location intelligence derivable from phishing site visitor IP logging.
- **Physical security hardening:** Ensure that disclosed facility locations are protected by appropriate physical access controls including reception screening, access card enforcement, visitor management systems, and CCTV coverage, recognising that public disclosure of facility addresses increases the risk of social engineering-based physical access attempts and hardware implant delivery by adversaries who have conducted physical location reconnaissance. 
- **Jurisdiction-aware incident response planning:** Incorporate physical location intelligence awareness into incident response planning, ensuring that response procedures account for the legal and regulatory implications of the jurisdictions within which the organisation operates, including data breach notification obligations, law enforcement engagement protocols, and cross-border investigation considerations.

## Detection Strategy

### Passive Collection Visibility Limitations

Physical location reconnaissance conducted through passive OSINT collection against corporate websites, social media platforms, press releases, and regulatory filings generates no observable artefacts within the target organisation's IT infrastructure.  Direct detection of this activity is therefore largely infeasible through conventional monitoring controls, and detection resources yield significantly more value when focused on the downstream attack stages at which collected location intelligence is operationally applied. 

### Phishing Infrastructure Geolocation Detection

The most technically detectable active collection method within this sub-technique involves visitor IP logging on adversary-controlled phishing infrastructure. While the phishing page itself is hosted on adversary infrastructure and not directly monitored by the target organisation, defenders can implement the following complementary controls:

- **Email security platform monitoring:** Deploy email security gateways such as [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-for-office-365) and [Proofpoint Email Protection](https://www.proofpoint.com/uk/products/email-security-and-protection) with URL detonation and spearphishing detection capabilities to intercept phishing emails delivering links to adversary-controlled credential harvesting and visitor tracking pages before employees access them.
- **DNS and web proxy monitoring:** DNS filtering and web proxy platforms such as [Cisco Umbrella](https://umbrella.cisco.com/) and [Zscaler Internet Access](https://www.zscaler.com/products/zscaler-internet-access) can block access to adversary-controlled domains used as phishing and visitor tracking infrastructure, preventing employees from inadvertently exposing their location data to adversary IP logging systems.
- **Detection pivot to physical access indicators:** Defenders should monitor for physical access anomalies following periods of suspected digital reconnaissance, including unexpected visitor requests, social engineering-based facility access attempts, and suspicious deliveries to facility addresses that may indicate an adversary acting on collected physical location intelligence in support of **T1200 – Hardware Additions** or physical implant delivery operations.
