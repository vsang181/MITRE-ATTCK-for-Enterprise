# Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is a sub-technique of Active Scanning (**MITRE ATT&CK T1595.002**) in which adversaries systematically probe target hosts, applications, and network services to identify exploitable weaknesses. Unlike broad IP block scanning, vulnerability scanning is typically more targeted and purposeful, seeking to determine whether a specific host's configuration, software version, or exposed service aligns with a known exploit the adversary intends to deploy.

Scanners collect intelligence by interrogating **server banners**, **listening ports**, **HTTP response headers**, **SSL/TLS certificate metadata**, and **service fingerprints** to enumerate running software and associated version numbers. This information is then cross-referenced against public vulnerability databases such as the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**, **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**, and **Exploit-DB** to identify actionable weaknesses. Intelligence gathered through vulnerability scanning can support further reconnaissance (e.g., **T1593 – Search Open Websites/Domains**, **T1596 – Search Open Technical Databases**), capability development (e.g., **T1587 – Develop Capabilities**, **T1588 – Obtain Capabilities**), and direct exploitation attempts (e.g., **T1190 – Exploit Public-Facing Application**).

## Procedure Examples

The following threat actor groups and campaigns have been observed employing vulnerability scanning as part of their reconnaissance and pre-exploitation operations:

| Threat Actor / Campaign | Observed Activity |
|---|---|
| **APT28** (Fancy Bear) | Conducted large-scale internet-wide scans to identify vulnerable public-facing servers across government and defence sectors |
| **APT29** (Cozy Bear) | Performed widespread environment scanning to identify exploitable vulnerabilities ahead of targeted intrusion operations |
| **APT41** | Used [Acunetix](https://www.acunetix.com/) for SQL injection vulnerability scanning and [JexBoss](https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss) to enumerate vulnerabilities in Java EE application servers |
| **Aquatic Panda** | Leveraged publicly accessible DNS logging services to identify servers vulnerable to **Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)** |
| **Cutting Edge** | Used the open-source [Interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh) out-of-band interaction tool to identify Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances vulnerable to **CVE-2024-21893** |
| **Dragonfly** (Energetic Bear) | Scanned targeted OT/ICS-adjacent networks for vulnerable **Citrix** and **Microsoft Exchange** services |
| **Earth Lusca** | Conducted vulnerability scanning against public-facing servers of targeted organisations prior to exploitation |
| **Ember Bear** | Deployed publicly available tools including [MASSCAN](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan) and [Acunetix](https://www.acunetix.com/) for large-scale scanning of public-facing infrastructure |
| **Leviathan** (APT40) | Targeted end-of-life and unpatched network devices with known exploits, focusing on rapid deployment following initial identification |
| **Magic Hound** (APT35) | Conducted widespread scanning for **Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)**, **ProxyShell (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-27065)**, and **Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPN (CVE-2018-13379)** vulnerabilities |
| **Sandworm Team** | Systematically scanned network infrastructure for vulnerabilities as part of pre-operational planning in support of destructive attack campaigns |
| **SharePoint ToolShell Exploitation** | Scanned for SharePoint servers vulnerable to **CVE-2025-53770** as part of a targeted exploitation campaign |
| **TeamTNT** | Scanned for vulnerabilities in IoT devices and exposed **Docker API** endpoints to facilitate cryptojacking and container compromise operations |
| **Volatile Cedar** | Performed targeted vulnerability scans against specific victim-facing servers ahead of web-based exploitation |
| **Winter Vivern** | Used remotely hosted instances of [Acunetix](https://www.acunetix.com/) to conduct vulnerability reconnaissance against European government and defence targets |

## Mitigations: Pre-Compromise (MITRE M1056)

Vulnerability scanning is conducted entirely from adversary-controlled infrastructure against publicly reachable systems, placing it outside the effective scope of conventional enterprise perimeter controls. Preventive mitigation of the scanning activity itself is not readily achievable; however, organisations can significantly reduce the intelligence value of such scans and limit the exploitable attack surface through the following measures:

- **Patch and vulnerability management:** Maintain a mature vulnerability management programme using tools such as [Tenable Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus), [Qualys VMDR](https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/), or [Rapid7 InsightVM](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightvm/) to ensure internet-facing systems are consistently patched and remediated ahead of adversarial scanning cycles.
- **Service banner suppression:** Configure all externally reachable services to minimise or obfuscate software version disclosures in server banners, HTTP headers (e.g., suppress `Server:` and `X-Powered-By:` headers), and SSL/TLS certificates where possible.
- **Attack surface reduction:** Decommission end-of-life systems, close unnecessary ports, and enforce strict firewall rules to limit the number and type of services exposed to the internet.
- **Proactive self-scanning:** Conduct regular authenticated and unauthenticated vulnerability scans against your own external-facing infrastructure using tools such as [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/) or [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2) to identify and remediate weaknesses before adversaries can exploit them.
- **Threat intelligence monitoring:** Monitor threat intelligence platforms such as [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/), [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/), and [Shodan Monitor](https://monitor.shodan.io/) for indicators of scanning campaigns targeting your industry sector or IP ranges.

## Detection Strategy

### Protocol and Traffic Pattern Analysis
Deploy **deep packet inspection (DPI)** and network intrusion detection capabilities to monitor for traffic patterns inconsistent with legitimate business communication. Key indicators of vulnerability scanning include:

- Extraneous or out-of-sequence packets that do not belong to any established network flow.
- Anomalous protocol usage, including malformed request syntax, unexpected HTTP method combinations, or non-standard SSL/TLS handshake patterns.
- Gratuitous or high-frequency probing of multiple ports or endpoints within a short time window, characteristic of automated scanning tools such as [Nmap](https://nmap.org/), [Masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan), [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2), or [Acunetix](https://www.acunetix.com/).

Network-based detection tools such as [Zeek (formerly Bro)](https://zeek.org/) and [Suricata](https://suricata.io/) can be configured with custom rule sets to alert on these scanning signatures in real time.

### Anomalous Process and Data Flow Detection
Monitor endpoint telemetry for processes initiating outbound or inbound network connections that fall outside their established communication baseline. Correlate network anomalies with **process execution logs** and **command-line argument monitoring** using tools such as **Sysmon**, **Windows Event Logs**, or an **EDR solution** (e.g., [CrowdStrike Falcon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/), [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint)) to identify scanning tooling executing on potentially compromised internal hosts. Aggregate and correlate these signals within a **SIEM platform** such as [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) or [Microsoft Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-sentinel), enriching source IP data with threat intelligence feeds from services such as [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) and [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) to contextualise scanning origin and intent.
